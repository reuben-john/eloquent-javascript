// Robot efficiency

// Can you write a robot that finishes the delivery task faster
// than goalOrientedRobot? If you observe that robotâ€™s behavior,
// what obviously stupid things does it do? How could those be improved?

// If you solved the previous exercise, you might want to use
// your compareRobots function to verify whether you improved the robot.
